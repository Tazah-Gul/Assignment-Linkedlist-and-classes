# Assignment-Linkedlist-and-classes
===================================
My first repository on GitHub.

This code contain 3 cpp files(complex numbers, linkedlist, main) and two header files(linkedlist, complex numbers). Header files contain declration of variables and functions and cpp file contain the code.
This code consist of two classes. First class is for addition, subtraction multiplication and division of complex numbers using operator overloading.
I also add exception logic where necessary for example in division of complex numbers.
Then I made another class "linkedlist" that can handle complex ADTs defined above and this class support following functios:

1 – Insert at end
2 – Delete at a given position
3 – value at position
4 – insert after a given position
5 – print the list

Then in main file I create a likedlist that stores following numbers:
1 – 4 + 5j
2 – 3 – 3j
3 – 4 + 3j
Then I add the first two numbers and store at the start of last. Then I subtract 1 and 3 and store at last, Multiply 2 and 3 and store at last, divide 1 by 3 and store at last then I delete element at position 4 and at an element at last.
I print the list after every single step.
Output of the code is:
7+2i
7+2i        0+2i
7+2i        0+2i        12-9i
7+2i        0+2i        12-9i        1+1.66667i
7+2i        0+2i        12-9i
7+2i        0+2i
